# Tick-TOC1 - Identifying Molecular Clocks
## Background
The behaviour and activity of animals, plants, and even bacteria is controlled by an internal timekeeper known as a **circadian clock**. This biochemical oscilllator has a steady rhythm and synchronises with fluctuating light levels. Even in the complete absence of light, our circadian clocks maintain an approximate 24 hour cycle. 

Identifying molecular clocks can help us better understand inherited disorders, such as **delayed sleep-phase syndrome**. The activity of these miniscule timepieces could also explain why heart attacks occur more often in the morning whereas asthma attacks are more common at night.

Given that so much of their activity is centred around solar time, molecular clocks are even more vital to the survival of plants. Each plant cell tracks time independently with just three regulatory genes (**LHY**, **CCA1**, and **TOC1**) involved in a negative-feedback loop. During the day, sunlight activates LHY and CCA1 transcription; in turn, these genes repress transcription of TOC1. As night falls, light levels dip and LHY and CCA1 are no longer upregulated. In the absence of repression, TOC1 is transcribed and promotes expression of LHY and CCA1. Each of these regulatory genes encode **transcription factors** that control expresion of many other genes by binding to **regulatory motifs** in their upstream regions.  

## Identification Techniques

One difficulty with using a computational method is that, unlike DnaA boxes which cluster together into clumps, regulatory motifs are scattered throughout the genome.
